## Player Performance Analysis

1. Read and combine tables
```{r}
# Read the Master and Stats tables
master <- read.csv("D:/23Fall/Second semester/6289-10/Final project/Baseball/archive/Master.csv")
batting <- read.csv("D:/23Fall/Second semester/6289-10/Final project/Baseball/archive/Batting.csv")
battingpost <- read.csv("D:/23Fall/Second semester/6289-10/Final project/Baseball/archive/BattingPost.csv")
fielding <- read.csv("D:/23Fall/Second semester/6289-10/Final project/Baseball/archive/Fielding.csv")
fieldingof <- read.csv("D:/23Fall/Second semester/6289-10/Final project/Baseball/archive/FieldingOF.csv")
pitching <- read.csv("D:/23Fall/Second semester/6289-10/Final project/Baseball/archive/Pitching.csv")
pitchingpost <- read.csv("D:/23Fall/Second semester/6289-10/Final project/Baseball/archive/PitchingPost.csv")

```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
# Combine the regular and post

batting <- bind_rows(batting, battingpost)

# Convert BAOpp in both data frames to numeric type
pitching$BAOpp <- as.numeric(as.character(pitching$BAOpp))
pitchingpost$BAOpp <- as.numeric(as.character(pitchingpost$BAOpp))

pitching <- bind_rows(pitching, pitchingpost)
```


2. Create criteria to evaluate the performance of a player in different positions.
