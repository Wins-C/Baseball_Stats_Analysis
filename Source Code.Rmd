## Player Performance Analysis

1. Read and combine tables
```{r}
master = read.csv("./archive/Master.csv")
batting0 = read.csv("./archive/Batting.csv")
battingpost = read.csv("./archive/BattingPost.csv")
fielding = read.csv("./archive/Fielding.csv")
pitching0 = read.csv("./archive/Pitching.csv")
pitchingpost = read.csv("./archive/PitchingPost.csv")
salaries = read.csv("./archive/Salaries.csv")
teams = read.csv("./archive/Teams.csv")
series_post = read.csv("./archive/SeriesPost.csv")
awards = read.csv("./archive/AwardsPlayers.csv")
  
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
# Combine the regular and post

batting <- bind_rows(batting0, battingpost)

# Convert BAOpp in both data frames to numeric type
pitching0$BAOpp <- as.numeric(as.character(pitching0$BAOpp))
pitchingpost$BAOpp <- as.numeric(as.character(pitchingpost$BAOpp))

pitching <- bind_rows(pitching0, pitchingpost)
```


2. Create criteria to evaluate the performance of a player in different positions.

A starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win.<br>Interpretation: While a win is an important statistic, its value can be somewhat misleading as it also depends on the team’s offensive performance and the bullpen's effectiveness. Therefore, it's not solely indicative of a pitcher’s performance.<br><br>Earned Run Average (ERA):ERA calculates the average number of earned runs a pitcher allows per nine innings pitched.<br>Fomula: ERA = (Earned Runs(ER)/Innings Pitched(IP))×9<br>Interpretation:  A lower ERA is indicative of better performance, showing that the pitcher allows fewer runs to score. It helps isolate the pitcher’s performance by focusing on earned runs, hence offering a clearer view of how well a pitcher controls the game.<br><br>Strikeouts (SO):A strikeout occurs when a pitcher throws three strikes to a batter during his at-bat, leading to the batter's dismissal.<br>Interpretation: High strikeout totals often correlate with elite pitching performance. Pitchers who can achieve high strikeouts typically possess superior pitching skills, including velocity and pitch movement, and are less dependent on the fielding behind them to get outs."))),
